# virtual-browser-os-list

This is an exhaustive list of virtual machines/emulators of computers (x86, RISC, etc.) that will run in your browser.

This is still a work in progress.

I will accept pull requests for those who want to add more to this README.

## Categorization

A listing will look something like this:

Name
Author
Link(s)
architectures emulates
What it runs

For the first example I will use Copy's [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86):

Name: v86

Author: Copy

Link(s): [GitHub](https://github.com/copy/v86), [Website](https://copy.sh/v86)

Architecture(s): x86 (Pentium III level)

What it runs: See the [v86 README](https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/master/Readme.md) for OS compatibility or the [website](https://copy.sh/v86) for demos
